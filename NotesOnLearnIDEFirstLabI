IMPORTANT -- learn open

  As the button Open in IDE isn't working in my browsers and OS (Chrome, Firefox, Chromium)u,
    Lubuntu 16.04, you (me) must run
      learn Open
    to open each lab.



        Other commands:
        --> learn
              reports on some only mandatory activities as listed in the README file;
              didn't report the creation and deletion of files;

              terminal response:
              First Lab:
                you made an edit to edit-me.txt
              Finished in 0.00588 seconds (files took 0.16828 seconds to load)
              1 example, 0 failures
